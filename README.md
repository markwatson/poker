# poker

I'm a program that evaluates poker hands given a set of cards.

## Usage

### Running from source

To use this first get [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen), and then execute:

     $ lein compile
     $ lein trampoline run

It's important to use trampoline since otherwise reading from STDIN doesn't work. (See [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7707558/clojure-read-line-doesnt-wait-for-input) Stack Overflow question).

### Running from binary

Just run the jar file:

     $ java -jar target/poker-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar

### Getting rankings

Pass in any number of poker hands as STDIN into the program seperated by newlines, and the rank will be written to STDOUT. For example:

     Ah As 10c 7d 6s
     Pair of Aces

     Kh Kc 3s 3h 2d
     2 Pair

     Kh Qh 6h 2h 9h
     Flush
